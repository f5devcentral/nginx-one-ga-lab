## NGINX OSS (Optional)

The NGINX One Console supports both NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS. Both products leverage the NGINX Agent to communicate with the NGINX One Console API.
The UDF blueprint contains a Ubuntu host with the package maintainer’s version of NGINX OSS installed.  In this section we will install NGINX Agent and connect this instance to the NGINX One Console.

### Generating a Data Plane Key

Since you were instructed to revoke your Data Plane Key at the end of the previous lab, you will need to generate a new one.

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left hand menu under the "Manage" section, select **Data Plane Keys**.

1. Click **Add Data Plane Key**.

1. Give the key a name based on your lab's ephemeral name, such as **<GetVariable name="petname" />-nginx-key**

    > :point_right: **Note:** You are working in a shared environment; keep track of your resources, and be careful not to accidentally modify anyone else's.

1. By default, the key expiration date will be set to 1 year.  Depending on your use case, you may want to set a shorter expiration date.  For this lab, we will use the default value.

1. Click **Generate**.

1. The Data Plane Key will be displayed. Click the *Copy* icon to copy the key to the clipboard.

    > :warning: **Warning:** *SAVE THIS KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE.* There is no way to retrieve the key after you click **close**. This key will be used until the completion of this lab.

### Create a Config Sync Group

1. Create a Config Sync Group called **<GetVariable name="petname" />-manual** based on what you learned earlier in the lab. Note this name, as you will need it in the commands you run below.

### Installing NGINX Agent on NGINX OSS

1. Connect to the "NGINX OSS" instance in UDF through the Web Shell access method by clicking the *Open Web Shell* button below:

    <UDFComponent
        name="NGINX OSS"
    />

1. Because the hostname is used as the name of the instance in NGINX One, you should change the hostname to something that identifies it as yours, such as **<GetVariable name="petname" />-ubuntu-oss**.
Ensure that you are working on the NGINX OSS instance (default hostname ip-10.1.1.6), and run the following command below using only lowercase characters and hyphens.

    > **Note:** The bash prompt will continue to show the previous hostname unless you log out and log back in. This does not affect the lab.

        ```bash
        sudo hostnamectl set-hostname {{petname}}-ubuntu-oss
        ```

1. From the NGINX OSS instance, run the following command to install the NGINX Agent, and automatically join the Config Sync Group you created above. In the command below, make the following substitutions:

    - Substitute **data-plane-key** with the key you created above
    - Substitute **config-sync-group** with the name Config Sync Group you just created

    ```bash
    curl https://agent.connect.nginx.com/nginx-agent/install | DATA_PLANE_KEY='data-plane-key' sh -s -- -y -c config-sync-group
    ```

    > Note: Make sure you are working on the NGINX OSS instance; if you accidentally install on the jumphost, the installation will succeed, but there will be no NGINX instance for the agent to connect to and the instance will appear as "Offline". If this occurs, return to the [directions in lab 1](nginx-one-1.mdx#generating-a-data-plane-key) to create a new Data Plane Key.

    The install script will install any necessary dependencies, and install the NGINX Agent with the appropriate settings for your system. You will see a warning about "stub_status" not being configured. You can ignore that warning, as we are not using any features that currently require it.

1. Return to the NGINX One console. From the left menu in the *Manage* section, click *Instances*. You should see your new instance in the list.

1. Click its hostname to view the instance details.

    ![Instance list](media/lab4-2.png)

1. Explore the instance details.

    ![Instance Details](media/lab4-3.png)

    > Notice this instance has a different set of configuration recommendations than the NGINX Plus instance you used earlier in the lab did. Package maintainers may ship NGINX OSS with their own sets of defaults, which may or may not align with best practices. NGINX One provides a centralized view of such recommendations across the organization.

## NGINX Docker (Optional)

The **Lab Framework** from the UDF environment has **docker** installed and is setup so it can run an NGINX Plus container image. The container image we will use here is **private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian** which has NGINX Plus with the Agent. If you want to see a list of all NGINX Plus with Agent image tags, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-docker/#pulling-the-image).

1. In the NGINX One Console, go to the *Details* page of the last Config Sync Group you created.

1. Click *Add Instance to Config Sync Group*.

1. Select *Register a new instance with NGINX One then add to config sync group*, then click *Next*.

1. If you saved your Data Plane Key from a previous lab, select *Use existing Key*. Otherwise select *Generate new key*.

1. Provide your Data Plane Key if you selected *Use existing Key*.

1. Select the *Docker Container* tab.

    ![Add New NGINX Plus Container](media/lab5-17.png)

    > **Note:** This system already cached the container image, so Steps 1 and 2 from the image above can be skipped.

1. Open a Web Shell to the **Lab Framework** UDF instance and start an NGINX Plus container with the commands to join it to your Config Sync Group.

    <UDFComponent
        name="Lab Framework"
    />

1. Execute the *docker run* command outlined in Step 6 to start the NGINX Plus with Agent container. Use the shell command below, with the following substitutions:

    - Substitute **data-plane-key** with the key you used above
    - Substitute **config-sync-group** with the name Config Sync Group you just created

    ```shell
    sudo docker run \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_GRPCPORT=443 \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_HOST=agent.connect.nginx.com \
    --env=NMS_SERVER_TOKEN="data-plane-key" \
    --env=NGINX_AGENT_INSTANCE_GROUP=config-sync-group \
    --env=NMS_TLS_ENABLE=true \
    --restart=always \
    --runtime=runc \
    -d private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian
    ```

1. Click *Done* to close the window.

1. In the console, navigate to *Instances*. You will see that a new NGINX Plus instance added to the NGINX One Console. This instance will be randomly named based on the Docker container that was created, since a name was not provided.

## Lab Cleanup

Time to clean up the resources you created in this lab. As a safety precaution, the NGINX One console will not allow you to delete an instance that is online. We will first have to shut down the instances before deleting them from the NGINX One console.

1. In the UDF deployment for this lab, click *Details* for the **NGINX OSS** component.

    ![Select the NGINX component details](media/cleanup-1.png)

1. Click the **Stop** button for this component.

    ![Select the NGINX component details](media/cleanup-2.png)


1. Open a Web Shell to the **Lab Framework** UDF instance.

    <UDFComponent
        name="Lab Framework"
    />

1. Execute the *docker stop* command with the following substitution:

    - Substitute **container-id** with the hostname of the Docker container NGINX Plus instance appearing in the *Instances* list of the NGINX One Console. (Hint: you saw it in Step 10 of the previous section).

    ```shell
    docker stop container-id
    ```

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Instances*.

1. Wait until your **<GetVariable name="petname" />-ubuntu-oss** and Docker container instance transition into the **Unavailable** state before proceeding. You may need to click the *Refresh* button at the top right of the instance list.

1. On each of your instances, select the *Actions* "..." context menu, and select
    *Delete*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are deleting your own instances and not someone else’s.

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-5.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Config Sync Groups*.

1. Delete your **<GetVariable name="petname" />-manual** Config Sync Group by selecting the *Actions* "..." context menu, then select *Delete*.

    ![Delete Config Sync Group](media/cleanup-8.png)

1. Confirm the deletion.

    ![Confirming the deletion](media/cleanup-9.png)

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left-hand menu in the *Manage* section, select *Data Plane Keys*.

1. Select the context menu for the Data Plane Key you created earlier in this lab, and select *Revoke*.

    > :warning: **Warning:** Make sure you are revoking your own key and not someone else’s.
