description: An interactive lab highlighting the NGINX One Console

NGINX made big news at the F5 annual user conference, [AppWorld](https://www.f5.com/appworld), by introducing [NGINX One](https://www.nginx.com/introducing-nginx-one/). NGINX One will give all F5 and NGINX customers access to a SaaS console for managing NGINX instances as part of the [F5 Distributed Cloud](https://www.f5.com/cloud). **NGINX One is released for testing in Early Access, and will be GA (Generally Available) in September.**

Once live, NGINX One will give NGINX users unrivaled visibility, delivery and optimization capabilities combined with the speed and flexibility of the F5 Distributed Cloud Platform.

You will be able to accelerate application delivery and time-to-value like never before with flexible pricing and SaaS capabilities.

With NGINX One, you will get improved:

- Performance at scale
- Visibility and insight
- Security and control

## Introduction

This lab will give you an overview of how NGINX One Console provides visibility into a global fleet of NGINX instances, both NGINX Plus and NGINX Open Source (OSS).

After this lab, you will be able to:

- Access and navigate the NGINX One console,
- Manage NGINX configuration
- Review recommendations from the NGINX One console
- Setup Config Sync Groups
- Install the NGINX Agent on both NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances (optional)

## Prerequisites

### UDF Blueprint

The "NGINX One Enablement Lab" blueprint contains the NGINX Plus and NGINX OSS instances that you will use during this lab. You should be comfortable accessing resources in UDF using SSH.

## Accessing Console

1. Log into your F5 Distributed Cloud Sales tenant.

1. Select the "NGINX One" product from the home screen.

1. The NGINX One welcome screen will appear. Click "Visit Service" to proceed to the NGINX One console.

    ![The NGINX One Welcome Screen](media/lab1-2.png)

1. The NGINX One Dashboard shows an overview of your environment, including availability, platform and version distribution, and CVEs/configuration recommendations. Your dashboard will vary depending on what is installed in your tenant. Feel free to click around and explore.

1. In the left-hand menu in the "Manage" section is the "Instances" link. You may or may not have any existing instances in your tenant. Don’t worry if there aren’t any, you will be deploying two instances later in the lab. If there are any existing instances, click an instance’s hostname to view its details.

## Connecting to the Console

NGINX One uses an agent installed alongside NGINX to communicate with the NGINX One service.

![There are two instances in the customer environment: one Plus and one OSS. An additional NGINX Agent is installed alongside NGINX in each instance, and the Agent communicates between the NGINX instance and the NGINX One service.](media/lab2-1.png)

The agent uses a Data Plane Key to authenticate and identify itself to NGINX One. In this lab we will create a new Data Plane Key, and use it to install the NGINX Agent on the NGINX Plus instance.

### Generating a Data Plane Key

1. From the NGINX One console, in the left hand menu under the "Manage" section, select "Data Plane Keys".

1. Click "Add Data Plane Key".

1. Give the key a name based on your lab's ephemeral name, such as *<GetVariable name="petname" />-nginx-key*.

    > :point_right: **Note:** You are working in a shared tenant; keep track of your resources, and be careful not to accidentally modify anyone else's.

1. By default, the key expiration date will be set to 1 year.  Depending on your use case, you may want to set a shorter expiration date.  For this lab, we will use the default value.

1. Click "Generate"

    ![Generating a Data Plane Key](media/lab2-4.png)

1. The Data Plane Key will be displayed. Click the "Copy" icon to copy the key to the clipboard.

    > :warning: **Warning:** *SAVE THIS KEY SOMEWHERE SAFE.* There is no way to retrieve the key after you click close. This key will be used in multiple labs.

    ![Data Plane Key](media/lab2-5.png)

1. Now enter the Data Plane Key in the *Set Variable* component below and click the *Save* button; this will allow the lab guide to use the key in further steps.

    <InputVariable 
        name="NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN"
    />

### Deploy NGINX Container

Now that we have a data plane key, we can attach our first NGINX instance to the NGINX One Console.

> **Note:** This lab will focus more on the NGINX One Console and less on how to install NGINX Agent on your NGINX instance and connect the instance to NGINX One.  If this is something you would like to explore in greater depth, check out the optional labs at the end of this lab guide.

1. To start your NGINX instance, click the *Run* button for each NGINX instances to deploy them and have them automatically connect to the NGINX One Console:

    <DockerContainer>
        <Docker  
            name="nginx-plus-1"
            desc="NGINX Plus R32 with Agent."
            image="private-registry.nginx.com/nginx-plus/agent:debian"
            env={[
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_GRPCPORT", value: "443"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_HOST", value: "agent.connect.nginx.com"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_ENABLE", value: "true"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY", value: "false"},
                {name: "NGINX_AGENT_SERVER_TOKEN", isVariable: true, isSecret: true},
            ]}
            attrs={[
                { name: "volume", value: `${process.env["CONTAINER_MOUNT_BASE_DIR"]}/ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl` }
            ]}
        />
    </DockerContainer>

    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-plus-1"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-plus-2"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-plus-3"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-oss-1"
        isComponent="true"
    />
    <SetVariable
        name="nginx-oss-2"
        isComponent="true"
    />

1. Once the NGINX instance is up and running, press the *Test* button, to confirm the instance is online and responding to HTTP requests.

Now, lets get started on the lab!
